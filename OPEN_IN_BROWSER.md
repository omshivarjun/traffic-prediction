## Dashboard URL:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 What to Look For

### 1. Open the Dashboard
- Click the URL above or type it in your browser
- The page should load with a map

### 2. Open DevTools (Press F12)
- Click the **Console** tab
- Look for this message:
  ```
  ✅ Connected to prediction stream
  ```

### 3. Check the Network Tab
- Click the **Network** tab in DevTools
- Look for a request to `/api/predictions/stream`
- Status should show **(pending)** - this is GOOD! It means SSE is connected

### 4. Watch for Predictions
As predictions arrive, you should see in the Console:
```javascript
Received prediction: {
  segment_id: "LA_001",
  current_speed: 58.5,
  predicted_speed: 52.3,
  category: "moderate_traffic",
  ...
}
```

## 🗺️ Expected Dashboard View

### Map:
- Shows Los Angeles area
- May have markers (colored circles) for traffic predictions
- **Click a marker** to see prediction details in a popup

### Right Side Panel (Analytics):
- **Total Predictions**: Count of predictions received
- **Predictions/min**: Rate of incoming predictions  
- **Avg Accuracy**: Model accuracy metric
- **Category Distribution**: Charts showing traffic categories

### Top of Page:
- **Connection Status Badge**: Should be **"Live"** in green

---

## 🎨 Marker Colors

If you see markers on the map:
- 🟢 **Green** = Free flow traffic (>60 mph) - smooth sailing!
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Moderate traffic (45-60 mph) - some slowdown
- 🟠 **Orange** = Heavy traffic (30-45 mph) - significant delays
- 🔴 **Red** = Severe congestion (<30 mph) - gridlock!

---

## 🧪 Test It Live!

### Send More Events:
Open a **NEW PowerShell** terminal and run:
```powershell
cd C:\traffic-prediction
.\scripts\send-test-events.ps1 -Count 10 -DelaySeconds 2
```

**Watch the dashboard!** New markers should appear every ~2 seconds as predictions arrive!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "This site can't be reached" or connection refused?
1. Check if server is still running (look for the PowerShell window)
2. If not, restart it:
   ```powershell
   Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd C:\traffic-prediction; npm run dev:default"
   ```
3. Wait 10 seconds, then try again

### No markers on the map?
This is NORMAL for the first load! Reasons:
1. **Consumer starting**: The Kafka consumer in Next.js takes a moment to connect
2. **No recent predictions**: Only predictions from segments LA_001-LA_005 show on map
3. **Coordinates**: Other segment IDs don't have coordinates yet (documented limitation)

**Solution**: Send test events using the script above!

### DevTools shows errors?
- **Red errors** in console? Copy them and check the troubleshooting guide
- **SSE connection error**? Check if `/api/predictions/stream` endpoint is accessible
- **Cannot find module**? The dashboard compiled successfully, this shouldn't happen

### Still stuck?
Read the comprehensive guide:
```powershell
code docs/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

You know it's working when:
- [ ] Dashboard loads without blank screen
- [ ] DevTools Console shows "Connected to prediction stream"
- [ ] Network tab shows `/api/predictions/stream` as (pending)
- [ ] When you send events, Console shows "Received prediction" messages
- [ ] Markers appear on map (may take a minute on first load)
- [ ] Clicking markers shows popup with prediction data
- [ ] Analytics panel updates with metrics

---

## 🎊 You Did It!

If you see the dashboard and predictions flowing, you've successfully:
- ✅ Built a complete ML traffic prediction system
- ✅ Integrated Kafka, Spark, and Next.js
- ✅ Created real-time streaming predictions
- ✅ Visualized ML outputs on an interactive map

**Congratulations!** 🎉

## 📸 Next Steps

1. **Take screenshots** of the working dashboard
2. **Test with continuous events**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\send-test-events.ps1 -Count 50 -DelaySeconds 3
   ```
3. **Monitor performance** (check latency, throughput)
4. **Document actual metrics** (update COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md)
5. **Plan enhancements** (coordinate loading, history, filters)
