## Safety Validation Architecture

### 1. Input Data Validation (Dual-Layer Protection)

**Purpose:** Prevent garbage data from entering the system that could cause incorrect predictions.

**Implementation:** `src/validation/input_data_validator.py` (700+ lines)

**Test Results:** 22/22 tests passing ✅

**Key Validations:**
- ✅ Traffic speed bounds (0-120 mph)
- ✅ Volume ranges (0-8000 vehicles/hour)
- ✅ Occupancy percentage (0-100%)
- ✅ Congestion levels (0-5)
- ✅ Coordinate validity (Los Angeles region)
- ✅ Highway identifiers (I-405, I-110, etc.)
- ✅ Timestamp format and reasonableness
- ✅ Sensor ID format
- ✅ Missing required fields detection
- ✅ Type validation for all numeric fields

**Rejection Handling:**
- Invalid records logged to separate topic: `rejected-traffic-events`
- Detailed rejection reasons captured
- Metrics tracked for monitoring

### 2. Output Prediction Validation (Safety Bounds)

**Purpose:** Ensure ML predictions are physically possible and safe before sending to frontend.

**Implementation:** `src/validation/safety_validator.py` (315 lines)

**Test Results:** 14/14 tests passing ✅

**Key Validations:**
- ✅ Speed bounds (0-120 mph, highway-specific limits)
- ✅ Volume sanity (0-10,000 vehicles/hour)
- ✅ Occupancy limits (0-100%)
- ✅ Congestion level bounds (0-5)
- ✅ Anomaly detection (sudden speed changes >50 mph)
- ✅ Cross-field consistency (high speed ≠ high congestion)
- ✅ Prediction metadata completeness
- ✅ Confidence score validation

**Safety Guarantees:**
- No physically impossible predictions
- No extreme value outliers
- No contradictory traffic states
- All predictions include confidence scores

### 3. ML Model Accuracy Verification

**Purpose:** Ensure predictions are accurate enough to be safe for real-world use.

**Models Tested:**
1. **RandomForestRegressor** (100 trees, max_depth=20)
2. **GradientBoostingRegressor** (100 trees, max_depth=10)

**Test Dataset:**
- Source: METR-LA real-world Los Angeles traffic data
- Records: 9,379 samples (after feature preparation)
- Features: 15 engineered features (lag, temporal, rolling stats)

**Results:**

#### RandomForest Speed Prediction
```
MAE:  0.48 mph  ⭐ EXCELLENT

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Retraining Process

**Issue:** Original models incompatible with NumPy 1.26.4 (pickle version mismatch)

**Solution:** Complete model retraining with current library versions

**Script:** `scripts/retrain_ml_models.py` (500+ lines)

**Key Steps:**
1. Extract nested METR-LA data structure (traffic_data, location, weather fields)
2. Create temporal features (hour, day_of_week, rush hours)
3. Generate lag features (speed_lag_1, speed_lag_2, speed_lag_3)
4. Compute rolling statistics (rolling_mean_3, rolling_std_3)
5. Encode categorical features (highway, direction)
6. Train RandomForest and GradientBoosting models
7. Export to HDFS with metadata

**Training Results:**
```
Dataset: 59,616 records → 59,409 samples after feature engineering
Training: 47,527 samples (80%)
Testing: 11,882 samples (20%)

RandomForest Training:
  MAE:  0.39 mph
  RMSE: 0.72 mph
  R²:   0.9997

GradientBoosting Training:
  MAE:  0.35 mph
  RMSE: 0.61 mph
  R²:   0.9997

Congestion Classifier:
  MAE:  0.01
  R²:   0.9954
```

**Model Storage:**
- Location: HDFS `/traffic-data/models/`
- Files:
  - `random_forest_speed.joblib` (124 MB)
  - `gradient_boosting_speed.joblib` (8.5 MB)
  - `random_forest_congestion.joblib` (3.6 MB)
  - `scaler_features.joblib` (1.4 KB)
  - `encoder_highway.joblib` (0.5 KB)
  - `model_metadata.json` (685 bytes)

### Data Structure Challenges Resolved

**Challenge:** METR-LA data has nested JSON structure

**Original Structure:**
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "sensor_id": "LA_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-18T19:52:15",
  "location": {
    "highway": "I-405",
    "latitude": 34.055,
    "longitude": -118.224
  },
  "traffic_data": {
    "speed_mph": 108.2,
    "volume_vehicles_per_hour": 424,
    "occupancy_percentage": 38.2,
    "congestion_level": 3
  },
  "weather": {
    "condition": "light_rain",
    "temperature_f": 82
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Extract nested fields before feature engineering
```python
df['speed'] = df['traffic_data'].apply(lambda x: x.get('speed_mph'))
df['volume'] = df['traffic_data'].apply(lambda x: x.get('volume_vehicles_per_hour'))
df['occupancy'] = df['traffic_data'].apply(lambda x: x.get('occupancy_percentage'))
df['highway'] = df['location'].apply(lambda x: x.get('highway'))
```

### Feature Engineering

**15 Features Used:**
1. `hour` - Hour of day (0-23)
2. `day_of_week` - Day of week (0-6)
3. `day_of_month` - Day of month (1-31)
4. `month` - Month (1-12)
5. `is_weekend` - Weekend indicator (0/1)
6. `is_morning_rush` - Morning rush hour 7-9 AM (0/1)
7. `is_evening_rush` - Evening rush hour 4-6 PM (0/1)
8. `speed_lag_1` - Speed from previous timestep
9. `speed_lag_2` - Speed from 2 timesteps ago
10. `speed_lag_3` - Speed from 3 timesteps ago
11. `speed_rolling_mean_3` - 3-period moving average
12. `speed_rolling_std_3` - 3-period rolling standard deviation
13. `volume_lag_1` - Volume from previous timestep
14. `occupancy_lag_1` - Occupancy from previous timestep
15. `highway_encoded` - Encoded highway identifier

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved Issues ✅

1. ✅ **NumPy Version Incompatibility**
   - Problem: Old models pickled with NumPy <1.20
   - Solution: Retrained with NumPy 1.26.4

2. ✅ **Nested Data Structure**
   - Problem: METR-LA data has nested JSON fields
   - Solution: Extract fields in feature preparation

3. ✅ **NaN Handling in GradientBoosting**
   - Problem: GradientBoosting doesn't accept NaN
   - Solution: Drop all NaN rows after feature engineering

4. ✅ **Corrupted Training Script**
   - Problem: `src/ml/metr_la_ml_training.py` had severe corruption
   - Solution: Created clean replacement script

### Current Limitations

1. **Historical Data Only**
   - Currently using September 2025 METR-LA dataset
   - Need to integrate real-time data pipeline for production

2. **Single Region**
   - Models trained on Los Angeles traffic only
   - May need retraining for other cities

3. **No Batch Processing Pipeline**
   - Manual script execution for retraining
   - Should automate with Airflow/cron for production
