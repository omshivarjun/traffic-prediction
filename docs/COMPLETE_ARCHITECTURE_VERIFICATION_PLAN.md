## Risk Assessment - Why This is CRITICAL

### Safety Impact
**"Accidents will happen due to wrong predictions"**

If any component is disconnected or data flow is broken:
- ‚ùå Traffic predictions will be based on incomplete data
- ‚ùå Real-time events may not reach the ML model
- ‚ùå Historical context may be missing
- ‚ùå Model training may use stale data
- ‚ùå Frontend may show outdated information
- ‚ùå **Result: Incorrect predictions ‚Üí Traffic accidents ‚Üí Loss of life**

### Zero Tolerance Requirements
Every connection MUST be verified because:
1. **Lives depend on accurate predictions**
2. **No partial data flows acceptable**
3. **Every component critical to overall accuracy**
4. **Chain is only as strong as weakest link**
