# 🎯 YOUR NEXT STEPS - START HERE!

## Current Situation
- ❌ Docker Desktop is NOT running
- ✅ All code is complete and tested
- ✅ Automated scripts ready to execute
- ⏳ Waiting for you to start Docker

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **STEP 1: Start Docker Desktop** (Do this NOW!)

**Option A: From Start Menu**
```
1. Click Windows Start button
2. Type "Docker Desktop"
3. Click to open
4. Wait ~30 seconds for Docker to fully start
```

**Option B: From System Tray**
```
1. Right-click Docker Desktop icon in system tray (bottom-right)
2. If Docker is stopped: Click "Start"
3. If Docker is running but not responding: Click "Restart"
```

**How to know Docker is ready:**
```powershell
# Run this command in PowerShell:
docker ps

# You should see a table of containers, NOT an error message
```

---

### **STEP 2: Run the Automated Test** (After Docker is ready)

```powershell
# Navigate to your project (if not already there)
cd c:\traffic-prediction

# Run the complete setup and test
.\scripts\start-docker-and-test.ps1
```

**What this script does automatically:**
1. ✅ Waits for Docker to be ready
2. ✅ Verifies all containers are running
3. ✅ Starts the ML streaming predictor service
4. ✅ Sends 5 properly formatted test events
5. ✅ Waits 10 seconds for processing
6. ✅ Verifies predictions were generated
7. ✅ Shows you sample predictions

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Docker Desktop is running!
✅ kafka-broker1 is running
✅ spark-master is running
✅ Streaming predictor is already running
✅ Sent 5 events successfully!
✅ Predictions found in Kafka!
  • LA_001: 65.5 ↘ 58.3 mph (moderate_traffic)
  • LA_002: 55.0 ↘ 48.2 mph (heavy_traffic)
  • LA_003: 70.0 ↗ 72.1 mph (free_flow)
```

---

### **STEP 3: Start the Dashboard**

```powershell
# In the same terminal or a new one:
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
> traffic-prediction@0.1.0 dev
> next dev --turbo

  ▲ Next.js 15.1.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.local

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 2.5s
```

---

### **STEP 4: Open the Dashboard in Browser**

```
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
3. Open DevTools (Press F12)
4. Check the Console tab
```

**What you should see:**

**In the browser:**
- 🗺️ Map showing Los Angeles area
- 🔵 Colored markers for traffic predictions
- 📊 Analytics panel on the right side
- 💚 "Live" badge (connection status)

**In DevTools Console:**
```
✅ Connected to prediction stream
Received prediction: {segment_id: "LA_001", current_speed: 65.5, predicted_speed: 58.3, ...}
Received prediction: {segment_id: "LA_002", current_speed: 55.0, predicted_speed: 48.2, ...}
```

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 Green markers = Free flow (>60 mph)
- 🟡 Yellow markers = Moderate traffic (45-60 mph)
- 🟠 Orange markers = Heavy traffic (30-45 mph)
- 🔴 Red markers = Severe congestion (<30 mph)

---

### **STEP 5: Send More Events and Watch Live Updates**

**In a NEW PowerShell terminal:**
```powershell
# Send continuous events
.\scripts\send-test-events.ps1 -Count 20 -DelaySeconds 2
```

**Watch the dashboard:**
- New markers should appear every ~2 seconds
- Analytics panel metrics should update
- "Predictions/min" counter should increase
- No errors should appear in console

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Docker Won't Start
```
1. Restart your computer
2. Open Docker Desktop manually
3. Wait 1 minute for full startup
4. Try again
```

### Script Shows Errors
```powershell
# Check what's actually running:
docker ps

# Read the complete troubleshooting guide:
code docs/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

### Dashboard Not Showing Predictions
```
1. Check DevTools Console for errors
2. Verify SSE connection in Network tab
3. Look for "/api/predictions/stream" (should be active/pending)
4. Try refreshing the browser (Ctrl+F5)
```

### Still Need Help?
```powershell
# Read the comprehensive guides:
code COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
code docs/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md
code QUICK_START.md
```
